 NoSQL injection is a vulnerability where an attacker is able to interfere with the queries that an application makes to a NoSQL database. NoSQL injection may enable an attacker to:

- Bypass authentication or protection mechanisms.
- Extract or edit data.
- Cause a denial of service.
- Execute code on the server.

NoSQL databases store and retrieve data in a format other than traditional SQL relational tables.
